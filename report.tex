\section{Introduction}

Data science applies different methods, both qualitative and quantitative, in order to solve relevant problems and make predictions \parencite[78]{Waller2013}. One industry that can benefit from the applications of data science is the healthcare industry. According to the \textcite{oecd2010health}, improving productivity in the healthcare sector translates to public spending savings. McKinsey estimated that data analytics can reduce healthcare expenses by \$300 B to \$450 B per year in the U.S. alone \parencite{Groves2013}. One way of improving healthcare is to utilise data science to process the massive amounts of electronic health records that exist \parencite{Dalianis2015}. Data collected in healthcare can come in the form of physician notes, medical records, patient scans, and patient sensor data (such as wearables) \parencite{Adam2017}. However, obtaining said data may present several challenges due to patient privacy. 

Areas in healthcare that could have the most impact from the application of data science include early detection of diseases, precision medicine, optimisation of workflows, value-based healthcare, infection prevention and control, and clinical research \parencite[9]{Consoli2019}. This report is centred around the application of data science to predict diseases. It will review in detail the process of data analysis, from locating a data source, processing the data, and finally visualising and interpreting the results.

% The area of business I have chosen is healthcare.

% Healthcare is an industry where data science can have a huge impact. The application of data science can help to improve patient outcomes, lower costs, and improve the efficiency of the healthcare system. 

% There are many different use cases for data science in healthcare. Data science can be used to predict patient outcomes, to diagnose diseases, to develop new treatments, and to improve the efficiency of the healthcare system.
